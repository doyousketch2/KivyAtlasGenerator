# KivyAtlasGenerator  
Generates Kivy's .atlas files for spritesheets  

------
First you'll need Python.  Linux and OSX users should be fine as-is.  
Win users might need to download it from their website  
https://www.python.org/downloads/  

I used v3.4.2 to create this, so version 3 or higher is recommended.  
It's possible it'll run in fine in v2.7x  the code is simple,  
and I think Kivy does OK on either, so whatever's clever, ya know?  

------
Then you'll need Kivy.  It's easy to **install this with pip.**  
Pip should come with Python, but if not...

- Linux:
`sudo apt-get update && apt-get install pip pip3`

- OSX:
`sudo easy_install pip`

- Win:
if you don't have it, it's probably best to  
download a new version of Python from their website.  

------
**Installing Kivy**

- Linux:
`pip3 install kivy`

- OSX:
`pip install kivy`

- Windows:
`py -m pip install kivy`

------
Alright, once you're certain you have Python and Kivy,  
you can **run the KivyAtlasGenerator**  

- Linux:
`./main.py`

- OSX:
`./python -m main.py`

- Win:
`py -m main.py`
