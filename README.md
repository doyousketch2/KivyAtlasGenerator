# KivyAtlasGenerator  
Generates Kivy's .atlas files for spritesheets  

First you'll need Python.  
Either use your package-manager, sudo apt-get, or download from their website

I used version 3.4.2 to make it, so version 3 or higher is recommended.  
It's possible it'll run in fine in v2.7x  
the code is simple, and I think Kivy does fine on either,  
so whatever's clever, ya know?

Then you'll need Kivy.  It's easy to install this with pip.  
Pip should come with Python.  

- Linux:
`sudo apt-get update && apt-get install pip pip3`

- OSX:
`sudo easy_install pip`

- Win:
if you don't have it, it's probably best to  
download a new version of Python from their website  
https://www.python.org/downloads/  

------

- Linux:
`pip3 install kivy`

- OSX:
`pip install kivy`

- Windows:
`py -m pip install kivy`

------

Alright, once you're certain you have Python and Kivy,  
you can run the KivyAtlasGenerator  

- Linux:
`./main.py`

- OSX:
`./python -m main.py`

- Win:
`py -m main.py`
